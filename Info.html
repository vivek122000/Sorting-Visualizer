        <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
        <p>
            The Bubble Sort works by repeatedly comparing and swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
           The elements under comparision are shown in blue colour and after an element is placed at its correct position,its color changes 
           to green.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1>Selection Sort</h1>
        <p>
            The Selection Sort works by picking out the smallest element from the array and placing it at its correct position and 
            repeating the same for remaining elements through a loop.The bar position which is to be swapped with next minimum element is shown in
            blue and the current minimum element found in the array is shown in orange.After the complete iteration the bar in blue is swapped
             with the minimum element shown in orange and its colour changes to green when placed at correct position.The process continues for 
             each array position and finally the entire array turns green.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1>Insertion Sort</h1>
        <p>
            The Insertion Sort works by virtually splitting the array into sorted and unsorted part and picking the values from unsorted
             part one by one and placing in sorted part.The current element chosen to be placed at correct position is shown with blue colour and 
             the suitable position when finally found has the element placed at that position and the bar is now shown with green colour.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1>Merge Sort</h1>
        <p>
            The Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer works by recursively diving the array into two halves:left and right, until they cant be divided
            further and then merging the two halves in a sorted manner until finally the entire array is sorted (shown by dark green colour).During 
            each recursion the left half of the array is shown  in orange colour while the right half is displayed as orange,and as they are merged
             recursively, their colour changes to light green and finally during the merging occured at the completion of last remaining recursion, the colour of the bars
            becomes dark green.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h1>Quick Sort</h1>
        <p>
            Th Quick Sort is also a Divide and Conquer Sorting Algorithm which works by picking an element of array as pivot( in this case the last 
            element) and placing it at its correct position in the array, such that the the elements smaller than the pivot are to its left side and the
            larger elements are to its right side.Now the same operation is applied in a recursive fashion on the arrays to the left and right of the 
            corrected pivot position until finally the entire array is sorted.The partition function is applied in lomuto fashion where during the
            operation, the current element being compared with pivot is shown in yellow and after comparision and swapping (if needed), the elements
             smaller thanselected pivot are shown as orange and the larger ones are shown as pink, and when the pivot finally is placed at its correct
            position gets coloured in green.
